    This function traverses through a stream network using NHD stream segment

    of stream segments where each stream segment (1) a unique identifier and
    identified upstream and downstream segments.  Additionaly, dams must be mapped
    to stream segments and have their own unique identifiers. 

    The resulting fragment designations will be assigned the Dam ID for any fragment
    ending in a dam or another unique identifieer starting at the exit_ID number
    for fragments which end at the terminal point of a river (default value is 999000).
